excerpt: "A performance-portable framework for simulating chemically detailed, multiphase atmospheric chemistry across CPUs and GPUs"
collection: portfolio
---

TChem-atm couples gas–aerosol systems and runs efficiently on heterogeneous hardware using Kokkos. It integrates multiphase capabilities with TChem’s high-performance kinetics, supports automatic Jacobian construction, and works with stiff ODE solvers. Benchmarks show strong GPU speedups and consistent accuracy, providing a foundation for next-generation atmospheric models.

TChem-atm is available on Github [here](https://github.com/pcLAeroParams/tchem-atm).
