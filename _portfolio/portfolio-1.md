The stochastic particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC explicitly resolves the composition of individual particles in a given population of different types of aerosol particles. This approach tracks the evolution of the mixing state of particles due to emission, dilution, condensation, and coagulation.

PartMC is available on Github [here](https://github.com/compdyn/partmc).
