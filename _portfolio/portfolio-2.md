The PyPartMC project offers pip-installable Python bindings to PartMC. Both source and binary packages are available and ship with all PartMC dependencies included. PyPartMC exposes internal components of PartMC (utility routines and derived types) which then can serve as building blocks to develop PartMC simulations in Python.
