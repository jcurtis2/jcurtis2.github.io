I am currently a Research Scientist in the Department of Climate, Meteorology & Atmospheric
Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are 
aerosol model development, representation of aerosol mixing state, model error
quantification and the use of high-performance computing in atmospheric sciences.
