<p>The mixing state of soot particles in the
     atmosphere is of crucial importance for assessing their climatic
     impact, since it governs their chemical reactivity, cloud
     condensation nuclei activity, and radiative properties. To
     improve the mixing state representation in models, we present a
     new approach, the stochastic particle-resolved model
     PartMC-MOSAIC, which explicitly resolves the composition of
     individual particles in a given population of different types of
     aerosol particles. This approach tracks the evolution of the
     mixing state of particles due to emission, dilution,
     condensation, and coagulation. To make this direct stochastic
     particle-based method practical, we implemented a new multiscale
     stochastic coagulation method. With this method we achieved high
     computational efficiency for situations when the coagulation
     kernel is highly nonuniform, as is the case for many realistic
     applications. PartMC-MOSAIC was applied to an idealized urban
     plume case representative of a large urban area to simulate the
     evolution of carbonaceous aerosols of different types due to
     coagulation and condensation. For this urban plume scenario we
     quantified the individual processes that contributed to the aging
     of the aerosol distribution, illustrating the capabilities of our
     modeling approach. The results showed for the first time the
     multidimensional structure of particle composition, which is
     usually lost in sectional or modal aerosol models.
