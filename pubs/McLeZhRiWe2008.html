     simulation</h2>

<p>The method of moments (MOM) is a statistically based
     alternative to sectional and modal methods for aerosol simulation. The
     MOM is highly efficient as the aerosol distribution is represented by
     its lower-order moments and only these, not the full distribution
     itself, are tracked during simulation. Quadrature is introduced to
     close the moment equations under very general growth laws and to
     compute aerosol physical and optical properties directly from
     moments. In this paper the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) is used
     in a bivariate test tracking of aerosol mixing state. Two aerosol
     populations, one enriched in soot and the other in sulfate, are
     allowed to interact through coagulation to form a generally-mixed
     third particle population. Quadratures of varying
     complexity (including two candidate schemes for use in climate models)
     are described and compared with benchmark results obtained by using
     particle-resolved simulation. Low-order quadratures are found to be
     highly accurate, and Gauss and Gauss-Radau quadratures appear to give
     nested lower and upper bounds, respectively, to aerosol mixing
     rate. These results suggest that the QMOM makes it feasible to
     represent the generally mixed states of aerosols and track their
     evolution in climate models.
