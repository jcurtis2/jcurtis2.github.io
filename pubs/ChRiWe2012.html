<h2>Impacts of black carbon mixing state on black carbon nucleation scavenging: Insights from a particle-resolved model</h2>

<p>J.&nbsp;Ching, N.&nbsp;Riemer, and M.&nbsp;West

<p><i>Journal of Geophysical Research</i> <b>117</b>(D23209), 2012.

<p>This paper presents an advancement of the recently
     developed particle-resolved aerosol model PartMC-MOSAIC (Particle
     Monte Carlo-Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and
     Chemistry) to investigate the impacts of mixing state on cloud
     droplet formation and to provide a tool for the quantification of
     errors in cloud properties introduced by simplifying mixing state
     assumptions. We coupled PartMC-MOSAIC with a cloud parcel
     model. We initialized the cloud parcel simulation with hourly
     PartMC-MOSAIC model output from a 48-hour urban plume
     simulation. The cloud parcel model then explicitly simulated
     activation and condensational growth of the particles as the
     parcel underwent cooling at a specified rate and the particles of
     the aerosol population competed for water vapor. We used this
     capability to quantify the relative importance of size
     information versus composition information for the prediction of
     the cloud droplet number fraction, mass fraction of black carbon
     that is nucleation-scavenged, cloud droplet effective radius, and
     relative dispersion of the droplet size distribution by
     introducing averaging of particle-resolved information within
     prescribed bins. For the cloud droplet number fraction, both
     composition averaging and size-bin averaging individually led to
     an error of less than 25% for all cloud parcel simulations, while
     averaging in both size bins and composition resulted in errors of
     up to 34% for the base case cooling rate of 0.5 K/min. In
     contrast, for the nucleation-scavenged black carbon mass
     fraction, the results for size-bin averaging tracked the
     reference case well, while composition averaging, with or without
     size-bin averaging, led to overestimation of this quantity by up
     to 600%.
