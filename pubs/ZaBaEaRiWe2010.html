<h2>Particle-resolved simulation of aerosol size,
     composition, mixing state, and the associated optical and cloud
     condensation nuclei activation properties in an evolving urban
     plume</h2>

<p><i>Journal of Geophysical Research</i> <b>115</b>(D17210), 2010.

<p>The recently developed particle-resolved aerosol
     box model PartMC-MOSAIC (Particle Monte Carlo model&ndash;Model
     for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry) was used to
     rigorously simulate the evolution of aerosol mixing state and the
     associated optical and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation
     properties in an idealized urban plume. The model explicitly
     resolved the size and composition of individual particles from a
     number of sources and tracked their evolution due to
     condensation, evaporation, coagulation, emission, and
     dilution. The ensemble black carbon (BC)&ndash;specific
     absorption cross section increased by 40% over the course of 2
     days due to BC aging by condensation and coagulation. Threefold
     and fourfold enhancements in CCN/CN ratios were predicted to
     occur within 6&nbsp;h for 0.2% and 0.5% supersaturations (<i>S</i>),
     respectively. The particle-resolved results were used to evaluate
     the errors in the optical and CCN activation properties that
     would be predicted by a conventional sectional framework that
     assumes monodisperse, internally mixed particles within each
     bin. This assumption artificially increased the ensemble
     BC-specific absorption by 14&ndash;30% and decreased the single
     scattering albedo (SSA) by 0.03&ndash;0.07, while the bin
     resolution had a negligible effect. In contrast, the errors in
     CCN/CN ratios were sensitive to the bin resolution for a chosen
     supersaturation. For <i>S</i> = 0.2%, the CCN/CN ratio predicted
     using 100 internally mixed bins was up to 25% higher than the
     particle-resolved results, while it was up to 125% higher using
     10 internally mixed bins. Neglecting coagulation overpredicted
     aerosol water content and number concentrations (&lt;0.2
     <i>&mu;</i>m), causing errors in SSA from &minus;0.02 to
     0.035 and overprediction of CCN concentrations by 25&ndash;80% at
     <i>S</i> = 0.5%.
