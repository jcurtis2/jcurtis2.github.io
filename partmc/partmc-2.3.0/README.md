   * gnuplot for testcase plotting - <http://www.gnuplot.info/>


Installation
============

1. Install cmake and NetCDF (see above). The NetCDF libraries are
   required to compile PartMC. The `netcdf.mod` Fortran 90 module file
   is required, and it must be produced by the same compiler being
   used to compile PartMC.

2. Unpack PartMC:

        tar xzvf partmc-2.3.0.tar.gz

3. Change into the main PartMC directory (where this README file is
   located):

        cd partmc-2.3.0

4. Make a directory called `build` and change into it:

        mkdir build
        cd build

5. If necessary, set environment variables to indicate the install
   locations of supporting libraries. If running `echo $SHELL`
   indicates that you are running `bash`, then you can do something
   like:

        export NETCDF_HOME=/
        export MOSAIC_HOME=${HOME}/mosaic-2012-01-25
        export SUNDIALS_HOME=${HOME}/opt
        export GSL_HOME=${HOME}/opt

   Of course the exact directories will depend on where the libraries
   are installed. You only need to set variables for libraries
   installed in non-default locations, and only for those libraries
   you want to use.

   If `echo $SHELL` instead is `tcsh` or similar, then the environment
   variables can be set like `setenv NETCDF_HOME /` and similarly.

6. Run cmake with the main PartMC directory as an argument (note the
   double-c):

        ccmake ..

7. Inside ccmake press `c` to configure, edit the values as needed,
   press `c` again, then `g` to generate. Optional libraries can be
   activated by setting the `ENABLE` variable to `ON`. For a parallel
   build, toggle advanced mode with `t` and set the
   `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` to `mpif90`, then reconfigure.

8. Compile PartMC and test it as follows. Some tests may fail due to
   bad random initial conditions, so re-run the tests a few times to
   see if failures persist.

        make
        make test

9. To run just a single set of tests do something like:

        ctest -R bidisperse   # argument is a regexp for test names

10. To see what make is doing run it like:

        VERBOSE=1 make

11. To run tests with visible output or to make some plots from the
    tests run them as:

        cd test_run/emission
        ./test_emission_1.sh
        ./test_emission_2.sh
        ./test_emission_3.sh            # similarly for other tests
        gnuplot -persist plot_species.gnuplot # etc...

12. To run full scenarios, do, for example:

        cd ../scenarios/1_urban_plume
        ./run.sh


Usage
=====

The main `partmc` command reads `.spec` files and does the run
specified therein. Either particle-resolved runs, sectional-code runs,
or exact solutions can be generated. A run produces one NetCDF file
per output timestep, containing per-particle data (from
particle-resolved runs) or binned data (from sectional or exact
runs). The `extract_*` programs can read these per-timestep NetCDF
files and output ASCII data (the `extract_sectional_*` programs are
used for sectional and exact model output).
