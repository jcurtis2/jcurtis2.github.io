Sedimentation Exponential Test-case
===================================

The initial condition is a single species of particle with a
log-normal distribution and the simulation uses the sedimentation
kernel. No analytical solution is known for this case, so a sectional
code is used as verification. By default this testcase uses 10^3
particles, which is not enough to resolve the larger peak in the mass
density. Increasing to 10^5 particles (or 10^7 with flat weighting)
fixes this at the expense of a longer computation.

This test-case demonstrates the use of the sectional model and
comparison of sectional runs with particle-resolved runs.
