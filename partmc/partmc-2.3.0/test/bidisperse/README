Sedimentation Bidisperse Test-case
==================================

Starting from many small particles and one large particle, we simulate
with the particle-resolved code. For this case, we can write an ODE in
one variable (either number of small particles or volume of large
particle), which we solve as a comparison.

The output plots show both small-particle number and large-particle
volume. We disable doubling to avoid generating multiple large
particles, which would result in large-large coagulations and so the
ODE would no longer be valid. While this means that the simulation is
not all that interesting physically, it is an interesting test-case
that sectional codes cannot do well. The lack of resolution towards
the end of the particle-resolved simulation is expected.
