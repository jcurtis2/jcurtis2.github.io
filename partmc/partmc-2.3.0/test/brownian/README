Brownian Lognormal Test-case
===================================

The initial condition is a single species of particle with two
overlapping lognormal distributions and the simulation using the
brownian kernel. No analytical solution is known for this case, so a
sectional code is used as verification. By default this testcase uses
10^5 particles, performing nine particle-resolved simulations and
averaging to acheive a better mean estimate.

This test-case demonstrates the use of the sectional model and
comparison of sectional runs with particle-resolved runs.
