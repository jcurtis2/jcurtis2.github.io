        <h1>Atmospheric Aerosols: A multiscale problem</h1>
	<p>
	Macroscopic impacts of aerosol particles on climate and on
	human health are ultimatively tied to processes that occur on
	the per-particle level. Field observations show that
	individual aerosol particles are a complex mixture of a wide
	variety of species, such as soluble inorganic salts and acids,
	insoluble crustal materials, trace metals, and carbonaceous
	materials. This reflects differences in their sources, but
	also differences in the chemical and physical transformations
	that the particles undergo in the atmosphere. This represents
	a great challenge for current chemical transport models, since
	the computational resources to resolve this much detail are
	limited. Simplifications are therefore necessary, however we
	often do not know the uncertainties that are introduced by
	such practise.
	</p>
	<h1>Particle-resolved aerosol models</h1>
	<p>
	  <p>
	  The question of how to represent aerosol in models
	  has led us to develop the stochastic particle-resolved
	  model <a href="http://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/mwest/partmc/">PartMC</a>-MOSAIC. This
	  aerosol model is designed to resolve the composition of
	  individual aerosol particles.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  This figure shows how we conceptually think of a particle
	  population: Particles live in a high-dimensional composition
	  space where each model species represents one
	  dimension. With time the particles move through this space
	  as a result of various processes that act on them. We sample
	  the aerosol distribution using a large number of
	  computational particles and evolve them using the
	  appropriate probabilities for coagulation, interleaved with
	  deterministic processes such as condensation of secondary
	  aerosol species. This has the advantage of tracking particle
	  composition without making any approximating assumptions.
	  </p>

	 

	<p>We use this model for different purposes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              As a benchmark and error quantification tool for more
              approximate models, for example sectional, moment or
              modal models.
            </li>
            <li>
	      As a coarse graining tool for deriving parameters for
	      more approximate models.
            </li>
	    <li>
	      As a modeling tool to perform detailed studies on the
	      particle scale and for experimental intercomparison.
            </li>
          </ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	  This figure shows an example of a two-dimensional projection
	      of the particle number distribution from a
	      particle-resolved simulation. In this case we use
	      particle size and black carbon mass fraction as
	      independent variables, and we see that particles at a
	      given size can have a wide range of black carbon mass
	      fractions. The inset shows that we can even obtain more
	      detailed information on an individual particle level,
	      for example the source information of any particle in the
	      population, or its composition.
